# Stumpff series
## Efficient computation of the stumpff series

Computing the value of the [Stumpff
series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stumpff_function) is important
in celestial mechanics.  Altough most the series might be expressed in
terms of trignometric functions, singular points make hard to compute
those function.

Here we provide a minimalistic python version of the stumpff series.

To test just run:

```
  make
```

Read the `test.py` source code to see how to use the routines in the
main file `stumpff.py`.

If you find a more shorter and efficient way to compute the Stumpff
series please write to

If you use it please mention this repo.

Happy Stumpff!
